## 💡 Project Overview

Danzle is service that aims to help users learning K-pop choreography on their own by utilizing Mediapipe for motion recognition, SAM2 for choreography visualization, and 3D technology to overcome challenges and provide continuous motivation. 

<br>

## 📍Pain points

- **Problem 1: Time and Financial Constraints**
    
    Many people want to attend dance academies but feel burdened due to time limitations or financial reasons.
    
- **Problem 2: Difficulty in Monitoring One’s Own Movements**
    
    When learning choreography through YouTube, it’s hard to check whether your moves are correct without a mirror. It’s also difficult to compare your dance and the instructor’s performance side by side in real time.
    
- **Problem 3: Limited Enjoyment and Engagement**
    
    Practicing alone often lacks interaction and fun, making it easy to lose interest. Without sharing videos or participating in dance teams and performances, practice tends to be repetitive and solitary, offering little sense of achievement or feedback. These limitations can be addressed by incorporating engaging elements like challenges.
    
<br><br>

### We created **Danzle** — a service designed to help users practice dance more effectively by providing accurate feedback on their movements and supporting continuous skill improvement.

<br><br>

## ⭐️ Main features

### 1. **Choreography Practice**

This is the core feature that allows users to freely practice choreography for the song of their choice. It also provides a personalized learning path through visual guidance.

| Practice |

<br>

### 2. **Motion Similarity Analysis and Feedback**

A key feature that compares the user’s actual movements with expert choreography in real time. It analyzes the performance and provides both numerical scores and text-based feedback.
Rather than simply mimicking the moves, users receive precise, AI-driven feedback that enhances both accuracy and engagement.

| Real-time Feedback | Overall Feedback | AI Feedback |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------|

<br>

### 3. Challenge mode

A fun feature where users can perform choreography alongside a 3D virtual idol character, adding an interactive and motivational element to practice.
